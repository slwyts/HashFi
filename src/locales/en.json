Same level referral → No burn, full rewards\n2. Cross-level referral → Burn to referrer's level cap\n   - Bronze refers Silver/Gold/Diamond → Only get rewards for 499U\n   - Silver refers Gold/Diamond → Only get rewards for 999U\n   - Gold refers Diamond → Only get rewards for 2999U\n3. Diamond level → Never burn\n\n**Example:**\n\nUser A (Silver level, invested 500U) refers User B (Gold level, invested 1000U)\nB's direct referral reward should be: 1000U × 5% = 50U\nBut A is Silver level, can only get 999U × 5% = 49.95U\nThe excess 0.05U is burned\n\n---\n\n## Dynamic Rewards\n\n### Direct Referral Reward (100-day release period)\n- 1st generation: 5% of investment\n- 2nd generation: 3% of investment\n- 3rd to 6th generation: 1% of investment\n\n### Sharing Reward (100-day release period)\n- Refer N people, earn N generations, max 10 generations\n- Each generation gets 5% of downline static rewards\n- Requires corresponding number of valid direct referrals to unlock generations\n\n### Team Reward (Instant distribution)\n\nAuto-upgrade based on small area performance, accelerate static rewards:\n\n| Team Level | Small Area Performance | Acceleration Rate |\n|---------|------------|----------|\n| V1 | 5,000 USDT | 5% |\n| V2 | 20,000 USDT | 10% |\n| V3 | 100,000 USDT | 15% |\n| V4 | 300,000 USDT | 20% |\n| V5 | 1,000,000 USDT | 25% |\n\n**Team Performance Calculation:** Exclude largest area, sum all other direct referral area performances\n\n---\n\n## Global Genesis Node\n\n### Application Requirements\n- Cost 5,000 USDT\n- Must have staked before\n- Requires admin approval\n\n### Reward Rules\n- Receive 10% of global static reward releases\n- Evenly distributed among all Genesis Nodes\n- 3x exit (auto-exit after receiving 15,000 USDT)\n- No node dividends after exit\n\n---\n\n## Important Notice\n\n### ✅ Advantages\n- On-chain smart contract, transparent\n- Decentralized wallet, secure assets\n- Auto reward distribution, no manual operation\n\n### ⚠️ Risk Warning\n- Cryptocurrency investment involves risks\n- Invest rationally, within your means\n- Recommend diversified investment across levels\n- Diamond level enjoys no-burn privilege\n\n### 📝 Notes\n- Must bind referrer before staking\n- HAF price set by backend, auto-increases daily\n- Withdrawal fee: 5%\n- Swap fee: 1%\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**How to avoid burn?**\n\nDirectly invest in Diamond level (3000U and above), never burn.\n\n**How are dynamic rewards released?**\n\nDirect and sharing rewards release linearly over 100 days, 1% of total daily.\n\n**How is team level calculated?**\n\nSystem auto-calculates your small area performance (excluding largest), auto-upgrades when requirements met.\n\n**What are Genesis Node benefits?**\n\nReceive 10% of global static rewards until reaching 15,000 USDT.\n\n---\n\n*Platform reserves final interpretation rights*"
